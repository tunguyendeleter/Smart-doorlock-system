### BLOCK DIAGRAM 
!["project"](blockdiagram.jpg)

- Central processing block: to collect and process data from sensors then control output devices.
**Input block**
    Temperature sensor: to measures body temperature in a certain temperature range, transmits data to microprocessor
    Ultrasonic sensor:  to measure the distance when hand washing
**Output block**
    LCD  : to display body temperature.
    Servo motor : to open or close faucet washing hands.
    LED : to notify alert tasks to users.
**Power suppy block**: to in charge of delivering power to all other blocks in the remaining system.
**Firebase block** : to get processed data from central processing block and store it on firebase interface


!["blockdiagram"](thread.jpg)
- **Core 0** will be used to control the LCD, receive signals from the temperature sensor MLX90614, and send temperature data to the firebase. 
- **Core 1** will be used to measure distance using the HC-SR04 sensor, control led, and servo.
